Considerations:
  is float really a good idea? Can we have precision issues? Should be fine for a range check...
  array sizes are not defined
  do we need to make a defensive copy?
  treemap or array with binary search?
  Random VS SecureRandom
  testRepartition: how to test we follow the probabilities? Try many times. Should check if there is some accepted methods out there.
